Users can gain Popularity (Reputation) by visiting and engaging in social events with other users of the application.
Users will be able to unlock new avitars, coupons, earn rewards ect by leveling up from visiting events and connecting with others 
at these events. This should keep users active on the web app, out and about, and meeting new people. Aside for the users engaged 
in this application, the event hosts or partners events good also gain in popularity by the crowds attracted by those users who activitly 
checked in while located at the event. 
Using mongoDB we could keep track of the data or popularity of an event or location based on the users and their connections made. We could use
this data in attracting new partners and hosts to the platform. We could also randomly ask our users for ideas and input
on opening new business or setting up events that people wish for.
